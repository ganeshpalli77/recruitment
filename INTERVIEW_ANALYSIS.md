## ✨ Features

### **Question-Level Analysis (1-5 Scoring)**
Each question-answer pair is scored using this rubric:
- **1 – Poor**: Off-topic, incomplete, very unclear
- **2 – Fair**: Somewhat relevant, but major gaps or low clarity
- **3 – Average**: Answers the question, but lacks depth or examples
- **4 – Good**: Clear, relevant, structured, with at least one example
- **5 – Excellent**: Complete, clear, confident, well-structured, strong example(s)

### **Overall Performance Assessment (1-5 Scoring)**
- **1 – Poor**: Struggled with most questions. Not interview-ready.
- **2 – Fair**: Some understanding but lacks depth. Needs significant improvement.
- **3 – Average**: Adequate performance. Correct answers but limited detail.
- **4 – Good**: Clear, structured answers. Strong performance with minor gaps.
- **5 – Excellent**: Outstanding performance. Interview-ready candidate.

### **Detailed Feedback Includes:**
- ✅ Individual question scores
- ✅ Specific strengths for each answer
- ✅ Areas for improvement
- ✅ Overall performance summary
- ✅ Key strengths across interview
- ✅ Key weaknesses to address
- ✅ Hiring recommendation
- ✅ Confidence level assessment
- ✅ Communication quality rating
